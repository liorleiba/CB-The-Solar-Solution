# CB-The-Solar-Solution
### **General description:**
A project analyzing the rapid growth, development, spread and ongoing activities of solar farms on recent decades around the globe.

### **Project's cause and purpose:**
When residential solar energy equipment was first made available to homeowners it was costly. The people who made the switch were usually those who wanted to make a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprints. But they also had the means to invest in the equipment and services needed to make that switch. In the beginning, like many other new technologies, initial adopters often paid more until the technologies become more mainstream.

Yes, solar energy is increasingly becoming a viable fuel source for everyone. Today, switching to solar energy is far more affordable with the help of programs like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). This incentive provides a tax credit of 26 percent of the cost to install solar power at your home. While this credit is in effect at 26% until the end of 2022, once it expires, solar energy will still remain a low-priced source of power as prices will most likely continue to drop. Meanwhile, oil, gas, and coal prices are likely to continue to increase, especially as sources are depleted and the costs to obtain these fuels grow.

I've explored the alternate solution to the energy problem, which is **the solar market**. I've researched it's growth and it's spread globally in the past years, to see how the world is running into the inevitable shifting to using solar energy as the planet's main resource.
